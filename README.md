# RadNet-EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis Project in R for RadNet Data
The final report is *EDA_Project.nb.html*

The file EDA_Project.Rmd is the RStudio Notebook with all the R code and markdown text for generating the EDA Project report *EDA_Project.nb.html*.
Required data files for the code are *places_data.csv* and all the csv files in the directory/subsdirectories of *radnet_data/*. 
The R code needs to be run from the root directory of the checked-out repository for the code to find the files it needs to import.
